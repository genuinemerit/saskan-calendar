Define methods to drive interactive use of the MuseBox system.
This module provides the main entry point for the MuseBox system,
allowing users to create, open, and manage compositions.

class CompositionPlan:
    """
    A composition plan is a static map of the steps needed to generate a piece of music
    using MuseBox components. It is like the control script for an ETL process.
    Each step of the plan produces specific metadata and saved outputs (JSON files,
    for the most part). Each step is logged using CompositionHistory methods. Each
    of the steps are handled using interface and middleware methods defined in the
    CompositionEngine class.

    The actual progress of a particular composition, that is, creation of objects, dicts,
    files and status updated, occurs in instances of the Composition class.

    A new instance of a CompositionPlan requires a Theme input.
    To edit an existing plan, use the CompositionHistory class to restore a previous state.

    The main steps of the plan are:
    1. Obtain the Theme and name the piece.
    2. Select MotifGrammar, MotifRules, and MotifStructure. (?) This includes key.
    3. Select RhythmPatterns. (May need to happen before step 2.)
    4. Define or iterate over the Phrases.
    5. Define the Voice(s) and their roles, including optionally instrumentation.
    6. Compose the music in the form of a music21 Stream, a MIDI file and/or a JSON
       or MusicXML file.
    7. Play, publish, or export the music.

    At each step, actions are logged by CompositionHistory and the plan instance is
    updated with discrete data structures for each step.  Any saved step can be restored
    using the CompositionHistory class, and then edited further using the CompositionEngine.

    As the system evolves, the CompositionPlan is likely to include additional metadata
    and sub-steps to handle more complex compositions, such as:
    - Multiple themes or motifs.
    - Complex rhythmic structures.
    - Dynamic changes in instrumentation.
